This a happy_b_telegram_bot (my first bot!) created with Telegram API and <a href=https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot>python-telegram-bot wraper</a>.

It sends videos(stored locally in /videos) when corresponding option is chosen in a list and stores log of pressed buttons in csv file. Back << button, restart /r are useful features for the user.

You can use the bot by writing to @HBEbot in Telegram.
